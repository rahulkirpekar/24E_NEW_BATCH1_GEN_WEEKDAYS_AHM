Features of Constructor
***************************
1.Constructor Name
Must have the same name as the class.

No return type (not even void).

2.Types of Constructors
Default Constructor (no arguments)

Parameterized Constructor (with arguments)

3.Automatic Default Constructor
If no constructor is defined, Java automatically provides a default constructor.

4.Constructor Overloading
Multiple constructors can be defined in a class with different parameter lists.

5.Cannot Be Abstract, Static, Final or Synchronized
Constructors cannot be declared as abstract, static, final, or synchronized.

6.Used for Object Initialization
Primary purpose: initialize instance variables when object is created.

7.Can Call Other Constructors Using this()
Used for constructor chaining within the same class.

this() must be the first statement in the constructor.

8.Can Call Superclass Constructor Using super()
Used to invoke parent class constructor.

super() must be the first statement if used.

9.Inheritance Behavior
Constructors are not inherited, but subclass constructors can call superclass constructors.

10.Access Modifiers Allowed
Can have access modifiers: public, private, protected, or default (package-private).

11.Private Constructors
Can restrict object creation (used in Singleton Pattern).

12.Constructor Execution
Always executes automatically when an object is created using new.

13.Cannot Be Called Directly
Called automatically during object creation; cannot call like a regular method.
